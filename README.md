# Real-Time-Chat-Application

Estimated time: 6 hours
Main Focus: Local storage, Backend setup, WebSockets, Responsiveness

What is that I have to build?
You have to build a real-time chat web application using any frontend stack and Strapi for backend. The application should facilitate instant messaging between user and server through WebSocket communication i.e. if a client sends a message to the server, the server should send back the same message to the client. The application must be responsive and capable of running smoothly on various screen sizes and devices. Chat should be between user and server and not between multiple users.

What will my solution contain?

Backend Setup: Set up a backend server using Strapi, an open-source headless CMS, to provide a robust backend infrastructure for the application.

User Authentication: Implement a basic user authentication system. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application.

WebSocket API: Develop a WebSocket API that echoes client messages. When a client sends a message to the server, the server should send back the same message to the client. Ensure that the WebSocket connection is properly established and maintained throughout the communication process.

Interface: Design an intuitive chat interface where users can send and receive messages. Users should also be able to switch between sessions.

Local Database Storage: Implement local database storage to store chat sessions and other data. This includes storing user authentication data, chat session history, and any other relevant data necessary for the application's functionality.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the web application is responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The user interface should be visually appealing and functional across various devices.

Additional Features (Optional): Consider adding additional features to enhance the user experience.
